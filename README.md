## Installing

To add support for `react-native` to Vitest, you need to install this plugin and add it to your Vitest configuration file.

```shell
# with npm
npm install vitest-react-native -D

# with yarn
yarn add vitest-react-native -D

# with pnpm
pnpm add vitest-react-native -D
```

## Usage

```js
// vitest.config.mjs
import reactNative from "vitest-react-native";
// this is needed for react jsx support
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactNative(), react()],
});
```

Instead of using a plugin, you can also add a "setup" file yourself:

```js
// vitest.config.mjs
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    // plugin adds this condition automatically
    conditions: ["react-native"],
  },
  test: {
    setupFiles: ["vitest-react-native/setup"],
    // this is required for this plugin to work
    globals: true,
    server: {
      deps: {
          external: ["react-native"],
      },
    },
  },
});
```
